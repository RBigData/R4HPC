# Three Basic Concepts in Hardware

???
# GPU - NVIDIA
# MIC - Intel KNL - ARM

* Manycore chip with memory on the chip instead of separate memory boards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXhlDt2SD8o
  * A manycore that can act as a GPU
  * Multocores are MIMD and can run anything
  * GPU are SIMD and more limited
