# Using R on HPC Clusters Webinar

* A basic workflow for how to use R on an HPC cluster
* Speed up R scripts with parallel computing concepts
* Many packages in R offer parallel computing abstractions, yet they use a much smaller set of underlying approaches: 
   * multithreading in compiled code, the unix fork, and MPI
* We take a narrow path to focus on the direct approaches
* Targeted for current users of OLCF, CADES, ALCF and NERSC
* Others are welcome to the lecture portions but will not be able to participate in all of the hands-on activities

#### Objectives 

* Learn a workflow to edit R code on your laptop and run it on an HPC cluster

* Learn how to use multicore and distributed parallel concepts in R on an HPC cluster system

???
* The workflow is half the battle to manage frustration of new users
* HPC cluster has several parallel resources used simulatneously
* On a laptop, often one choice among approaches is made
* Many abstractions are a layer above the basics
   * foreach, dopar, futures
   * Understanding basics helps understanding the abstractions 
   * Add another layer to a complex situation - harder debug
   * Basics are closer to HPC community (largely C and C++) terminology
      * Helps understanding HPC language

* Some of the exercises can be done on a laptop but miss the important workflow socialization

## Working with a remote cluster using R

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/01-intro/Workflow.jpg")
```
???

* Please excuse my art
* Conveys what's needed but could be a LOT better
   * If someone has better skills, I'd be very grateful for a better pic
   
* A workflow that I've settled-on last few years
   * manages frustration with interactive - batch transition
   * I see it mostly from a macOS perspective but works in Windows too

### Laptop RStudio (Posit in October, 2022)
* Familiar custom editing environment (Windows, Mac, Unix)
* Interactive Syntax checking

### GitHub/GitLab
* Portability to remote computing
* Version control
* Collaboration

### Cluster unix
* Same environment for all
* Batch job submission

#### Advanced: interactive multinode development and debugging
* Available now (packages: launchr, pbdCS, pbdRPC, remoter)
* Needs further development (particularly launchr) and standardization

???
* Portability - in your basement or on another continent - remorely in EU
* RStudio on cluster:
  * Installs difficult: legacy OS on HPC
  * Bandwidth
  * Minor RStudio differences due to OS

???
Ultimate goal of workshop
* Pic of cluster use with R: 32 R sessions collaborating on 8 nodes
   * Laptop - login node - resource script - multi R session collaboration
   * BIG data on parallel file system - not on laptop!
   * Can monitor a longer run with logins to compute nodes
   * Batch

### Software Needed on Laptop
* Mac
   * R, RStudio
   
   * terminal, git (in Xcode)
   
* Windows
   * R, RStudio
   
   * putty
   
   * git

## Software on Cluster

* OpenBLAS
* FlexiBLAS
* OpenMPI
* HDF5 (for parallel I/O)
* R (>= 4.0)
* And various packages, including `RBigData/pbdMPI` (GitHub version)


#### R vs conda-R Deployment
* Direct R is preferred
* CRAN and Anaconda differ in package management philosophy
* Can end up with conflicts if mixing
* Adds a layer of complexity for the R user

???
* Complexity without obvious benefit if using current CRAN packages

# Making **git** easy: set ssh keys

* Private and Public key pairs for Client and Server

  * Git repository (GitHub, GigLab) is the server
  * Your laptop or remote cluster are clients

* Each client has own key-pair

  * Private key stays on the client
  * Public key is copied to the server

* Works like a single-use password generator and authentication

  * Client contacts server
  * Server sends a random string encrypted by client's public key
  * Client decrypts with own private key and sends to server
  * Server verifies agreement and opens secure connection

# Clusters are Linux systems
* Linux is one of many descendants of original Unix. MacOS is another.

* Like all file systems, Linux files are organized as a tree.

* When in a terminal, you are talking to a *shell* program (*bash* is most common)

   * Each command can have a list of *options* and a list of *arguments*
   * *Standard input* and *standard output* of a command is the terminal but can be redirected
   * **<**, **<<**, **>**, **>>** redirect standard input and output
   * *command1* **|** *command2* pipes standard output1 to standard input2
   * Commands are looked up in directories listed in your PATH variable (try "echo $PATH")
   * $ means substitute variable value
   * *export* lists (or sets) shell variables and their values

* There are many resources on the web to learn Linux basics

???
* A few unix things to explain scripts you will see

## Hands-on Session 1 - On Login Node
* Below, replace `MACHINE` with your cluster name (andes, cades are available)
* Go to `R4HPC/code_0` directory and run
   * `./packages_MACHINE.sh` to install all R packages that will be used

* Go to `R$HPC/code_1` directory and run
   * `sbatch hello_MACHINE_slurm.sh` to run a script that illustrates a basic two-level parallelism
   * We will return to this script throughout the workshop as we learn its components

* Examine output in `hello.e` and `hello.o` and notice that:
  * 4 nodes are involved
  * 4 R sessions were running on each node for a total of 16
  * Each R session ran `mclapply` on several cores
  * All `mclapply` process id's are reported
  * The code figured out how many cores in total
  * Only one R session wrote the output

# Unix `fork`
* A memory efficient parallelism on shared memory devices  

* Copy-on-write: copy page if forked process tries to write  

* R: **parallel** package `mclapply` and friends  
   * Use for numerical sections only
   * Avoid GUI, I/O, and graphics sections
* Convenient for data (not modified)

* Convenient for functional languages like R

* Careful with nested parallelism
  * OpenBLAS takes all cores by default
  * data.table switches to single threaded mode upon fork

### Each tree built from

* random subset of variables: subset of columns

* resampled (with replacement) data: same number of rows

### Use their majority votes to classify

# R-LAPACK-BLAS

* BLAS: Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines - A matrix multiplication library
  * `%*%`, `crossprod()`, `sweep()`, `scale()`, and many more

* LAPACK: dense and banded matrix decomposition and more
  * `svd()`, `La.svd()`, `prcomp()`, `princomp()`, `qr()`, `solve()`, `chol()`, `norm()`, and many more
  * But not `lm()`, careful with `qr(x, LAPACK = TRUE)`: column pivoting

* Implementations: OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, Nvidia nvBLAS, Apple vecLib, AMD BLIS, Arm Performance Libraries

* **FlexiBLAS**: A BLAS and LAPACK wrapper library with runtime exchangeable backends
   * Great for benchmarking implementations
   * Great for dynamic core assignment

???
* Optimizes algorithm to chip microarchitecture details 
   * memory hierarchies (L1 cache, L2 cache, etc.) and 
   * register vector length
   
* FlexiBLAS Standardization of API for BLAS core control
   * C, C++, R, Python/numpy, Julia

## Faster BLAS For Faster R on your Laptop (macOS)

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Default BLAS from Netlib
> x = matrix(rnorm(1e7), nrow = 1e4)
> system.time(crossprod(x))
   user  system elapsed 
  6.752   0.023   6.801 
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
## vecLib (4 cores)
> system.time(crossprod(x))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.420   0.003   0.078 
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
## OpenBLAS (4 cores)
> system.time(crossprod(x))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.457   0.028   0.075 
```
---
## Install FlexiBLAS For BLAS Control on macOS Laptop

* Install Xcode and command line tools
* Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
* In a terminal window:
  * `brew install cmake`
  * `brew install openblas`
* cmake needs to be told about OpenBLAS: 
     * `export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openblas:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
* Install FlexiBLAS: https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/flexiblas
  * See Install section in its README.md
* After installation, link to R (terminal window):
  * `ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libflexiblas.dylib /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib`
* In R, `install.packages("flexiblas")` and test if it works:
  * `flexiblas_avail()`
  * `flexiblas_list()`

R can now swap OpenBLAS and APPLE vecLib dynamically. <br>
Dynamically control number of cores used in OpenBLAS. <br>
Control vecLib threads with VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS before starting R.

Long Install
